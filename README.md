## 🌍 Introduction

**Kikuyu-AI-model** is a language learning and translation platform focused on revitalizing the Kikuyu (Gĩkũyũ) language. Spoken by over 8 million people in Kenya, Kikuyu is increasingly under threat due to the widespread use of English and Swahili.

This project leverages AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to:

- Support personalized learning
- Facilitate translations between Kikuyu, Swahili, and English
- Integrate cultural and linguistic nuances
- Encourage educational adoption and community engagement

By bridging linguistic gaps and modern technologies, this tool supports both learners and researchers in deepening their understanding of the Kikuyu language and culture.

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Kikuyu-AI-model.git
cd Kikuyu-AI-model

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
# Launch the application (example with Streamlit)
streamlit run app.py
```

Or use the CLI:

```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can configure the model and platform behavior using the `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
language_pairs:
  - en-kik
  - kik-en
  - sw-kik
model:
  name: transformer_v1
  use_gpu: true
  max_seq_length: 128
```

---

## 🧪 Examples

```python
from kikuyu_ai.translator import Translator

translator = Translator(model="transformer_v1")
print(translator.translate("Good morning", source_lang="en", target_lang="kik"))
```

## 📚 Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is in progress and will be made available via GitHub Pages or [project wiki](https://github.com/yourusername/Kikuyu-AI-model/wiki).

Planned topics:
- Model training and fine-tuning
- Dataset formats
- API usage
- Extending language support

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Model not loading?** Ensure required weights are downloaded and environment supports GPU if enabled.
- **Audio not playing?** Check that the required media libraries are installed and supported by your OS.
- **Translation quality is poor?** Try retraining with a larger dataset or fine-tuning for your domain.

Feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/yourusername/Kikuyu-AI-model/issues) for help.
